### Python Comparative Analysis for Machine Learning

pycaML is an easy machine learning model comparison tool with optimization. It allows to generate a table comparing multiple machine learning models, to see which one is best for your data.
The unique feature of pycaML is built-in hyperparameters tuning using Bayesian Optimization. It also supports meta-models like Stacking and Voting ensembles. You can setup and optimize 16 models with one line of code.

# Installation  
```python pip install pycaML```

# Key Features

* Compare up to 16 different models with one line of code
* Hyperparameters tuning with built-in search spaces
* Stacking and Voting models support
* Automatic train-test split
* Built-in cross validation
* Saves every result in a nice .csv table

# Version 
pycaML is in early development, in the future many features are planned to be added.
